// hold NO secret of their own — they simply pass through whatever token the
// browser presented (X-VC-Token / Authorization). The backend validates the
// token (and, for browser-direct transports, the Origin). No-op on localhost,
// where no token is presented and the backend trusts loopback.
//
// NOTE: we deliberately do NOT forward the browser Origin here. Node/undici
// treats `Origin` as a forbidden request header and may silently drop it, so a
// "forward the Origin and let the backend allowlist judge it" scheme could fail
// open. Cross-origin (CSRF) requests are instead rejected up front by
// blockCrossSite() below — at the proxy, which is the boundary the browser
// actually reaches.

// --- Cross-site (CSRF) defense ----------------------------------------------
//
// The /api/* routes are an open same-origin proxy into a backend that turns
// requests into real command execution. The legitimate frontend ALWAYS calls
// them same-origin (a relative `fetch("/api/...")` from the app's own page), so
// any request the browser labels cross-site is hostile — a drive-by CSRF from
// another page open in the user's browser. We must reject those HERE, at the
// proxy, because the backend can't: the proxy hop drops the browser Origin, so
// the backend's own Origin allowlist never sees it for proxied requests (that
// allowlist still guards the browser-DIRECT WS terminal / SSE / debug paths,
// which the browser hits at :8000 without a proxy in between).
//
// Why this is reliable: `Sec-Fetch-Site` is set by the browser and cannot be
// forged or removed by page JS, so a value other than same-origin/same-site is
// proof the request did not originate from our own page. For the rare client
// that omits it we fall back to comparing the Origin's host to the request Host
// (a cross-site POST always carries an Origin). Non-browser callers (curl,
// native apps) send neither signal and are NOT a CSRF vector — they carry no
// ambient credentials — so they pass here and are left to the backend's own
// token/loopback auth.
export function isCrossSiteRequest(req: NextRequest): boolean {
  const site = req.headers.get("sec-fetch-site");
